                            <p>This paper proposes entitymetrics to measure the impact of knowledge units.
                                Entitymetrics highlight the importance of entities embedded in scientific
                                literature for further knowledge discovery. In this paper, we use Metformin,
                                a drug for diabetes, as an example to form an entity-entity citation network
                                based on literature related to Metformin. We then calculate the network
                                features and compare the centrality ranks of biological entities with results
                                from Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). The comparison demonstrates
                                the usefulness of entitymetrics to detect most of the outstanding interactions
                                manually curated in CTD.

                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>Currently, knowledge is being amassed rapidly; however, most of it is being
                                encoded as strings in unstructured scientific literature. Extraction of this
                                knowledge presently places a huge burden on already overloaded researchers,
                                as they must manually dig out the embedded knowledge by reading tons of
                                articles. This knowledge consists of many connected individual knowledge
                                units encapsulated as entities in scientific papers. These entities could
                                be authors, references, journals, and keywords that are commonly studied in
                                scholarly evaluation, or they could be datasets, key methods, genes, drugs,
                                and diseases that have not yet been widely explored in bibliometrics.
                                Effective knowledge transfer depends on efficient knowledge accumulation.
                                If these entities were decoded/annotated using a standard format (e.g.
                                XML tags or RDF triples) and following shared semantics (e.g., domain
                                ontologies, or controlled vocabularies), then connecting the entity dots
                                would be as easy as flipping a switch. A knowledge graph could then be
                                formed/accumulated automatically based on existing articles, and newly
                                published articles, to lead potentially to successful knowledge discovery [1].

                            <h2>Methodology</h2>
                            <p>Metformin (N",N"-dimethylbiguanide) is often referred to as a magic drug.
                                Originally, the drug was developed to treat Type II diabetes, however now,
                                it is also being considered to treat and prevent cancer, obesity, depression,
                                and aging [16]. Endocrinologists, cardiologists, oncologists, and aging
                                specialists have generated waves of interest by attempting to use
                                anti-diabetic biguanides to control body weight and tumor growth [48].
                                Metformin is the only anti-diabetic drug, which can prevent the
                                cardiovascular complications of diabetes and remains as one, of the only two,
                                oral anti-diabetics on the World Health Organization Model List of Essential
                                Medicines [49]. Obesity and cancer have interrelationships with aging [50].
                                Metformin is able moderately to reduce body weight for obese diabetics because
                                it can reduce insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia [51]. A recent study
                                found that children and adolescents are more responsive to metformin-induced
                                weight loss compared to adults [52].

                                features of this network. It compares the centrality ranks of the network
                                with results from the CTD. Entitymetric results, identifying the interaction
                                of Metformin with diseases, drugs, and genes, were consistent with the CTD
                                thereby demonstrating the usefulness of the entity level bibliometric approach
                                to detect most of the outstanding interactions manually curated in the CTD.
                                This paper proposes entitymetrics to measure the impact of knowledge units
                                at different levels. It highlights the importance of entities embedded in
                                scientific literature for further knowledge discovery. Compared with the
                                related work, entitymetrics advances the state of the art by taking knowledge
                                entity as the research unit to move bibliometrics to discovery knowledge.
                                It refines Swanson's method by utilizing B terms as knowledge entities.
